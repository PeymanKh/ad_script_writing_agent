key_principles:
  - "Capture attention within the first two seconds and remain thumb-stop worthy throughout, as Reels is engineered for algorithmic discovery based on watch time, sends per reach, and engagement velocity."
  - "Prioritize UGC-style footage, peer-to-peer demos, and real voices over polished studio work, as they drive higher trust and stronger perceived brand credibility."
  - "Keep content concise and fast-paced, delivering the message efficiently and focusing on one primary benefit or feature per ad."
  - "Embrace authenticity and relatability, mimicking user-generated content (UGC) or featuring real people in real-life scenarios."
  - "Showcase the app in action, demonstrating its core functionality and how it solves a problem or adds value."
  - "Strategically use trending audio for maximizing impact and leveraging algorithmic boosts when sound is enabled."
  - "Include a clear, prominent, and unambiguous call-to-action (CTA) that visually and verbally directs users to the desired action."
  - "Utilize deep-link CTAs to send users directly to the App Store or Google Play, minimizing friction in Reels’ impulse-driven environment."
  - "Continuously A/B test different creative elements to optimize performance and conversion rates."

do_and_dont_s:
  do:
    - "Build for a 6-15 second 'sweet-spot' duration, as shorter ads drive significantly more sales per-view than long-form content."
    - "Keep the ad concise and fast-paced with quick cuts and transitions, delivering the message efficiently."
    - "Open with a high-contrast hook (movement, text, or bold claim) in the first 0-2 seconds to maximize retention."
    - "Show app's core functionality visually by showcasing the app in action within 3 seconds, such as a screen recording overlay on a phone frame."
    - "Add on-screen captions or dynamic subtitles for silent-scrollers, as 80% of Gen Z watch with sound off."
    - "Use single-word CTAs like 'Install,' 'Play,' or 'Book' inside sticker overlays for immediacy."
    - "Employ the 4 C’s (Community-based, Captivating, Credible, Clear) to structure each scene."
  dont:
    - "Start with a slow introduction, lengthy intros, static brand logos, or disclaimers that delay the hook."
    - "Over-produce or make the ad look like a traditional commercial with overly glossy or generic stock footage."
    - "Neglect audio or use generic background music; leverage trending sounds or compelling sound design."
    - "Overwhelm with too much information; focus on one key message or primary benefit per ad."
    - "Hide CTA behind long copy; mobile eye-flow favors large, central tap targets."
    - "Stuff hashtags in ad copy, as Meta’s studies show negligible lift for hashtags in paid placements."
